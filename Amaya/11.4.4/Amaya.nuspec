    <summary>Amaya is a Web editor, i.e. a tool used to create and update documents directly on the Web. Browsing features are seamlessly integrated with the editing and remote access features in a uniform environment. This follows the original vision of the Web as a space for collaboration and not just a one-way publishing medium.

Work on Amaya started at W3C in 1996 to showcase Web technologies in a fully-featured Web client. The main motivation for developing Amaya was to provide a framework that can integrate as many W3C technologies as possible. It is used to demonstrate these technologies in action while taking advantage of their combination in a single, consistent environment.

Amaya started as an HTML + CSS style sheets editor. Since that time it was extended to support XML and an increasing number of XML applications such as the XHTML family, MathML, and SVG. It allows all those vocabularies to be edited simultaneously in compound documents.</summary>
    <description>Amaya is a complete web browsing and authoring environment.

    Amaya lets users both browse and author Web pages

    Using Amaya you can create Web pages and upload them onto a server. Authors can create a document from scratch, they can browse the web and find the information they need, copy and paste it to their pages, and create links to other Web sites. All this is done in a straightforward and simple manner, and actions are performed in a single consistent environment. Editing and browsing functions are integrated seamlessly in a single tool.
    Amaya maintains a consistent internal document model adhering to the DTD

    Amaya always represents the document internally in a structured way consistent with the Document Type Definition (DTD). A properly structured document enables other tools to further process the data safely.
    Amaya allows you to display the document structure at the same time as the formatted view, which is portrayed diagrammatically on the screen.
    Amaya is able to work on several documents at a time

    Several (X)HTML, native MathML (.mml) and SVG (.svg) documents can be displayed and edited at a time.
    Amaya helps authors create hypertext links

    The editor helps you create and text out links to other documents on the Web from the document you currently are working on. You can view the links and get a feel for how the information is interconnected. This feature is not limited to HTML anchors. With XLink, any MathML and SVG element can be a link too.
    Amaya includes a collaborative annotation application

    Annotations are external comments, notes, remarks that can be attached to any Web document or a selected part of the document.

You can find a more detailed description of Amaya and of its features in the W3C Note "An Introduction to Amaya."</description>
